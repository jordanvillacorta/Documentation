The repeat() method constructs and returns a new string which contains the specified number of copies of the string on which it was called, concatenated together.
const chorus = 'Because I\'m happy. ';

console.log(`Chorus lyrics for "Happy": ${chorus.repeat(27)}`);

// expected output: "Chorus lyrics for "Happy": Because I'm happy. Because I'm happy.
